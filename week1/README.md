### Simulators

Later in the course, we'll need to install tools provided by either Apple or Google to run our iPhone/Android apps. For now, we can simply run our apps using our device's web browser, however it's often easier when testing to use a simulated device so we don't have to constantly keep refreshing our phones. To download the 

For iPhone users:  
[Install XCode and iOS Simulator](https://github.com/jblinder/little-screens/wiki/Resources#xcode-and-ios-simulator)

For Android users:  
[Install the Android SDK](https://github.com/jblinder/little-screens/wiki/Resources#android-sdk-and-simulator)

### Hosting/Testing

We'll a need a url to point our simulator/device web browser to when testing out our code. You can choose to use GitHub, your CUNY website, or your own webserver to host your course assignments. However, if you just want to test locally there are a few good options.

* [Dropbox](http://www.creativepro.com/article/how-to-use-dropbox-a-web-server-3-easy-steps)
	* Recommended  - quick, simple, free
* [MAMP (Mac OSX)](http://www.mamp.info/en/) or [XAMPP (Windows)](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
	* Good for applications requiring a backend
* [Start a webserver from the command line](http://lifehacker.com/start-a-simple-web-server-from-any-directory-on-your-ma-496425450)
	* Great if you need to create a webserver immediately, but not a good long-term solution.
